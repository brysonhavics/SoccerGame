Great save by the keeper! |What a tackle, they lost the ball! |Corner kick. |Goal Kick. |
The crowd goes wild!!! |There's a streaker on the field, here comes security! |
Beautiful header, just misses the top corner! |FOUL!! |Substitution |We have a man down, looks like a flop | 
Awesome play by the defense! |Throw in by the home team. |Visitors throw in. |
That might be some of the finest passing we've seen all day! |WOW, the defense misread that play! |
What an amazing play by the offense!|Vintage stuff there|That shot just whistled past the post!|
The crossbar is still rattling from that!|Oh, he just about did enough|Rookie mistake there, he'll learn|Stupendious save!

|Nasty tackle |That was a rough foul |That was a dirty play |Well that's not allowed |Absolutely abhorent behaviour by the player |Tactical one innit |
Proper tackle, don't know what he's going on about |Games gone soft there |Just a little late to the challenge |I can see what he was trying to do there, he was just too slow

|Surely he'll be sent off!|No room for those challenges in this game|The referee will have a lot to say about that!|A last man tackle like that has to end in red|
I don't know what he was thinking there!|He must have said something to the ref|After an attempt like that I wouldn't be surprised to see a red!|
You can't throw an elbow like that in the modern game

What a shot|
